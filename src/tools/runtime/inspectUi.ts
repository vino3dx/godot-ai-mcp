    "Use it instead of scene_get_tree when you need real sizes: scene_get_tree only parses the .tscn text and cannot know what the " +
    "engine computed. THIS IS A RUNTIME PROBE: the scene is instantiated inside a temporary GDScript (never written into the project, " +
    "deleted afterwards) and its scripts run, so _ready/_process side effects DO happen; the probe itself never saves the scene and " +
    "never writes project files. It runs with a real window (non-headless) because the headless viewport is fixed at 64x64 and would " +
    "squash every layout number; width/height override the viewport size (default: project display/window/size settings). " +

    "summary, engineVersion and durationMs (wall time of the Godot process). Fails with GODOT_NOT_FOUND / FILE_NOT_FOUND / " +
